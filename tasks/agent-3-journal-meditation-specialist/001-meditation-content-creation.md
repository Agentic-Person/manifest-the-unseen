# Task 001 - Meditation Content Creation (Scripts & Audio)

**Status:** [ ] Not Started - REQUIRES PIPEDREAM MCP SERVER (for automation)

**Week/Phase:** Week 1-2 (Can Start Immediately)

**Agent:** Agent 3 - Journal/Meditation Specialist

**MCP Servers Used:**
- [ ] Whop MCP
- [ ] Supabase MCP
- [X] Pipedream MCP - **RECOMMENDED** (for audio generation pipeline)
- [ ] Puppeteer MCP

---

### Description

Write meditation scripts and generate audio files for the initial meditation library. Focus on Tibetan monk aesthetic: singing bowls, throat singing, 432Hz/528Hz frequencies. Create 7-10 foundation meditations to launch with.

---

### Technical Approach

Write meditation scripts manually with Tibetan monk guidance style. Use ElevenLabs for voice generation (or record manually). Use **Pipedream MCP** (optional) to automate the meditation generation pipeline (script → voice → mixing → CDN upload). Mix with Audacity or similar tool.

---

### Implementation Steps

1. Write 7-10 meditation scripts (10-15 min each)
2. Record or generate voice narration via ElevenLabs
3. Source/create ambient soundscapes:
   - Tibetan singing bowls (432Hz, 528Hz)
   - Gentle water sounds
   - Mountain wind
   - Fire crackling
4. Mix voice + ambient sounds in Audacity
5. Export as MP3 (256kbps) for streaming quality
6. (Optional) Use Pipedream MCP to automate workflow
7. Upload to CDN (Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3)
8. Create metadata for Supabase meditations table

### Script Template Example

```markdown
# Finding Your Signal (12 minutes)

[INTRO - Singing Bowl (432Hz) - 30 seconds]

Welcome, seeker. Find a comfortable position... close your eyes... and allow your breath to deepen.

[Pause 5 seconds]

In this moment, there is no rushing... no forcing... only being.

[Singing Bowl Tone - 10 seconds]

You are about to discover something profound. Beneath every desire you hold... beneath every "I want"... there is a signal. A frequency. A quiet knowing.

[Pause 5 seconds]

This signal is not loud. It does not shout. It whispers.

[Pause 5 seconds]

Begin now by bringing to mind something you wish to manifest. Perhaps it's love... abundance... peace... or purpose.

[Pause 10 seconds]

Notice where you feel this desire in your body. Is it in your heart? Your solar plexus? Your throat?

[Pause 5 seconds]

Now... go deeper. Beneath the desire... what is the signal?

[Continue script...]
```

### Notes for Junior Developer

**What needs to be built:**
This is the content creation phase. You're writing meditation scripts and producing audio files. This is NOT coding - it's creative work.

**Tibetan Monk Voice Style:**
- **Pace:** Very slow, with long pauses
- **Tone:** Deep, calm, grounded
- **Vocabulary:** Nature metaphors (mountain, river, stone, wind)
- **No rushing:** Let silence breathe
- **Sound healing:** Reference frequencies (432Hz, 528Hz), singing bowls

**Script Writing Tips:**
1. Start with ambient sound (singing bowl)
2. Welcome the listener with gentleness
3. Give clear but non-directive guidance
4. Use pauses generously (5-10 seconds between key points)
5. Reference the body (not just the mind)
6. End with integration time
7. Close with gratitude and a final bowl tone

**Audio Mixing Guidelines:**
- **Voice:** -10dB to -12dB (clear but not loud)
- **Ambient:** -18dB to -22dB (subtle background)
- **Singing Bowls:** -14dB to -16dB (present but not overwhelming)
- **Fade in/out:** 3-5 seconds for smooth transitions

**File Naming Convention:**
```
01-finding-your-signal-12min.mp3
02-frequency-over-force-10min.mp3
03-embodiment-practice-15min.mp3
```

**Common pitfalls:**
1. **Voice too loud:** Meditations should be gentle, not jarring
2. **Too many words:** Less is more. Use pauses.
3. **Generic language:** Avoid "relax and breathe" clichés. Be specific to manifestation.
4. **No sound healing:** This is a Tibetan aesthetic app. Include singing bowls, frequencies.
5. **Rushed pace:** Meditation should feel timeless, not rushed.

**Pipedream MCP Workflow (Optional):**
Create an automated pipeline:
1. Script input (text file)
2. ElevenLabs voice generation
3. Mix with pre-selected ambient soundscape
4. Normalize audio levels
5. Export as MP3
6. Upload to CDN
7. Insert metadata into Supabase

This saves hours of manual work for future meditations.

**Future improvements:**
- Create 50+ meditation library
- Add seasonal meditations (full moon, solstice)
- User-requested topics
- Personalized meditations based on user phase
- Multi-language support

**Resources:**
- [ElevenLabs Docs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs)
- [Audacity Manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/)
- [Solfeggio Frequencies Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solfeggio_frequencies)
