# Development Execution Plan

**Approach: 6-Week MVP with 4-Agent Parallel Development**

## Phase 1: Project Setup (Do Now)

1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and App Router
2. Install core dependencies (Whop SDK, Supabase client, Claude SDK)
3. Create project structure (app/, components/, lib/ directories)
4. Set up environment variables template
5. Create Supabase database schema with all tables
6. Configure Whop OAuth integration

## Phase 2: Agent Assignment & Parallel Development

### Agent 1 - "Frontend Lead"
- Build AI Mentor chat UI with streaming responses
- Create all 10 workbook phase interfaces (simplified forms)
- Build dashboard and navigation
- Implement progress tracking visualizations

### Agent 2 - "Backend Lead"
- Set up all API routes (/api/chat, /api/journal, /api/progress, /api/webhook)
- Integrate Claude API with prompt engineering
- Configure Supabase queries and row-level security
- Handle Whop webhooks and authentication

### Agent 3 - "Journal/Meditation Specialist"
- Build 4 journal types (daily, guided, scripting, signal tracker)
- Implement audio player component
- Create/generate 7-10 meditation audio files
- Build tracking systems (streaks, history)

### Agent 4 - "Integration Lead"
- Implement gamification (badges, progress %, streaks)
- Handle cross-pillar integrations
- Build user profile and settings
- Testing, optimization, and deployment

## Key Simplifications for Speed

- Text-only inputs (no drag-drop, fancy visualizations)
- ~50 workbook exercises total (vs 200+)
- 7-10 meditations (vs 50+)
- Basic AI context (phase + goal, not full history)
- No voice features for MVP

## Deliverable

Fully functional 4-pillar app with complete 10-phase journey in 6 weeks
