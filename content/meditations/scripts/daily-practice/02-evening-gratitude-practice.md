### ARRIVAL (0:00 - 1:00)

**[Bowl - 432Hz, warm and grounding]**

**[Water sounds begin - very gentle]**

Welcome to evening.

**[Pause 5s]**

The day is closing. You can rest now.

**[Pause 5s]**

Find a comfortable seat... or lie down if that calls to you.

**[Pause 5s]**

Let your eyes close.

**[Pause 7s]**

Feel the weight of the day begin to lift.

**[Pause 5s]**

You've done enough. You are enough.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Bowl - softer]**

### GRATITUDE - BODY (1:00 - 2:30)

Begin by thanking your body.

**[Pause 5s]**

It carried you through this day.

**[Pause 5s]**

Your feet... that walked you forward.

**[Pause 3s]**

Your hands... that created and touched.

**[Pause 3s]**

Your heart... that kept beating. Steady. Faithful.

**[Pause 7s]**

Your breath... that sustained you moment to moment.

**[Pause 7s]**

Thank you, body. For being my home.

**[Pause 10s]**

### GRATITUDE - DAY'S GIFTS (2:30 - 4:30)

Now... bring to mind three gifts from today.

**[Pause 5s]**

They need not be grand.

**[Pause 3s]**

Perhaps... a moment of laughter. A kind word. Warm food. Shelter.

**[Pause 7s]**

The sun rose. That alone is a gift.

**[Pause 7s]**

Name them silently... or aloud if you wish.

**[Pause 5s]**

One.

**[Pause 10s]**

Two.

**[Pause 10s]**

Three.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Bowl - gentle, appreciative tone]**

Feel the warmth of gratitude in your chest.

**[Pause 5s]**

Let it spread. Like honey. Like light.

**[Pause 10s]**

### RELEASE (4:30 - 6:00)

Now... if there is anything from today you need to release...

**[Pause 5s]**

A word left unsaid. An action you regret. A moment you wish had been different.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Water sounds slightly more present]**

Imagine placing it in a stream.

**[Pause 5s]**

Watch it float away. Carried by the current.

**[Pause 7s]**

You are not what happened today.

**[Pause 5s]**

You are the awareness that witnessed it all.

**[Pause 10s]**

Tomorrow is unwritten. Tonight... you rest.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Night sounds begin if using - very soft crickets]**

---

### CLOSING - SURRENDER TO SLEEP (6:00 - 7:00)

As you prepare for sleep... or continue your evening...

**[Pause 5s]**

Know this: You are held.

**[Pause 5s]**

By the earth beneath you. By the universe within you.

**[Pause 7s]**

You need not control tomorrow.

**[Pause 5s]**

Rest. Release. Receive.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Bowl - final, lingering tone - let ring fully]**

**[Fade - all sounds gently fade over 15 seconds]**
