## Script

### AWAKENING (0:00 - 1:00)

**[Chime - bright, clean strike]**

Good morning.

**[Pause 3s]**

Whether you've just awakened... or you've been moving for hours...

**[Pause 3s]**

This moment is your fresh start.

**[Pause 5s]**

Sit comfortably. Spine tall. Heart open.

**[Pause 3s]**

**[Bowl - 432Hz, clear and bright]**

Take a deep breath in.

**[Pause 3s]**

And release everything from yesterday.

**[Pause 5s]**

---

### INTENTION SETTING (1:00 - 3:00)

Today... you are setting a frequency. Not a to-do list.

**[Pause 3s]**

A frequency.

**[Pause 5s]**

Ask yourself: How do I wish to feel today?

**[Pause 5s]**

Not what you'll do. How you'll be.

**[Pause 7s]**

Perhaps... peaceful. Confident. Abundant. Creative. Connected.

**[Pause 7s]**

Choose one word. Let it come naturally.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Chime - gentle]**

Now... feel that quality. Not in your head. In your body.

**[Pause 5s]**

Where does peace live? Perhaps your shoulders drop.

**[Pause 3s]**

Where does confidence live? Perhaps your chest opens.

**[Pause 3s]**

Where does abundance live? Perhaps your belly softens.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Lift - uplifting ambient swell]**

This is your frequency for today.

**[Pause 5s]**

You don't have to force it. Just tune into it.

**[Pause 7s]**

---

### ACTIVATION (3:00 - 4:30)

Take a deep breath. Fill your lungs completely.

**[Pause 3s]**

And as you exhale... let this frequency radiate.

**[Pause 3s]**

From your center... outward.

**[Pause 5s]**

Again. Breathe in your frequency.

**[Pause 3s]**

Exhale it into the world.

**[Pause 5s]**

One more time. Breathe it in.

**[Pause 3s]**

Release it. Let it color your day.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Bowl - 528Hz, transformative tone]**

Whatever arises today... you return to this frequency.

**[Pause 3s]**

Your anchor. Your signal. Your choice.

**[Pause 7s]**

---

### CLOSING (4:30 - 5:00)

You are ready.

**[Pause 3s]**

Not because you have it all figured out.

**[Pause 3s]**

But because you know your frequency.

**[Pause 5s]**

**[Chime - final, bright strike]**

Go create your day.

**[Pause 5s]**

**[Fade - all sound to gentle silence]**
