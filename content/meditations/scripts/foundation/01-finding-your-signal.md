## Script

### INTRO (0:00 - 1:00)

**[Bowl - 432Hz, let it ring for 10 seconds]**

**[Wind begins softly in background]**

Welcome, seeker.

**[Pause 5s]**

Find a comfortable position... whether sitting... or lying down.

**[Pause 5s]**

Allow your eyes to close gently.

**[Pause 5s]**

In this moment... there is no rushing. No forcing. Only being.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Bowl - softer strike]**

---

### SETTLING (1:00 - 3:00)

Feel the earth beneath you. Solid. Steady. Holding you.

**[Pause 5s]**

Notice your breath. Not controlling it... simply witnessing.

**[Pause 5s]**

In... and out. Like waves upon a shore.

**[Pause 7s]**

Release any tension in your jaw. Your shoulders. Your hands.

**[Pause 5s]**

Let gravity do the work of holding you.

**[Pause 10s]**

You are safe here. Held by something far greater than thought.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Swell - ambient increases slightly]**

---

### CORE TEACHING - THE SIGNAL (3:00 - 8:00)

You are about to discover something profound.

**[Pause 5s]**

Beneath every desire you hold... beneath every "I want"... there is a signal.

**[Pause 7s]**

A frequency. A quiet knowing.

**[Pause 5s]**

This signal is not loud. It does not shout. It whispers.

**[Pause 7s]**

Bring to mind now... something you wish to manifest.

**[Pause 5s]**

Perhaps it is love. Perhaps abundance. Peace. Purpose.

**[Pause 10s]**

Notice where you feel this desire in your body.

**[Pause 5s]**

Is it in your heart? Your solar plexus? Your throat?

**[Pause 10s]**

Now... go deeper.

**[Pause 5s]**

Beneath the desire... what is the signal?

**[Pause 7s]**

The desire might say: "I want more money."

**[Pause 5s]**

But the signal... the signal knows: "I wish to feel safe. Expansive. Free."

**[Pause 10s]**

The desire might say: "I want a relationship."

**[Pause 5s]**

But the signal whispers: "I long to be seen. Known. Held."

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Bowl - gentle strike]**

Can you feel the difference?

**[Pause 7s]**

The desire lives in the mind. In the wanting.

**[Pause 5s]**

The signal lives in the body. In the knowing.

**[Pause 10s]**

Place your hand on the part of your body where this signal lives.

**[Pause 5s]**

Breathe into it. Slowly.

**[Pause 10s]**

This signal... this frequency... has been with you all along.

**[Pause 7s]**

Calling you. Guiding you. Waiting for you to listen.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Fade - ambient reduces slightly]**

---

### DIFFERENTIATION - FEAR VS FAITH (8:00 - 10:00)

There is another voice that speaks. You know it well.

**[Pause 5s]**

The voice of fear.

**[Pause 7s]**

Fear says: "What if you fail? What if you're not worthy? What if it doesn't come?"

**[Pause 7s]**

Fear vibrates at a different frequency than your signal.

**[Pause 5s]**

Fear is fast. Tight. Contracted.

**[Pause 7s]**

Your signal... is slow. Open. Expansive.

**[Pause 10s]**

Notice now... is there fear mixed with your desire?

**[Pause 7s]**

Not to judge it. Simply to see it.

**[Pause 10s]**

Breathe into the fear. Give it space.

**[Pause 7s]**

And beneath the fear... can you still feel your signal?

**[Pause 5s]**

Quiet. Steady. Certain.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Bowl - clear, confident strike]**

Your signal knows. It has always known.

**[Pause 7s]**

---

### CLOSING & INTEGRATION (10:00 - 12:00)

For the next moment... simply rest here.

**[Pause 5s]**

Connected to your signal. Your inner compass.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Swell - ambient increases warmly]**

As you move through your day... your week... your life...

**[Pause 5s]**

You can return to this place. This signal.

**[Pause 7s]**

It does not change with the winds of circumstance.

**[Pause 5s]**

It is the mountain. Not the weather.

**[Pause 10s]**

When you are ready... no rush...

**[Pause 5s]**

Begin to deepen your breath.

**[Pause 5s]**

Wiggle your fingers. Your toes.

**[Pause 5s]**

Bring gentle movement back to your body.

**[Pause 7s]**

And when it feels right... open your eyes.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Bowl - final, lingering strike - let ring for 15 seconds]**

**[Fade - all sound gently fades to silence over 10 seconds]**
