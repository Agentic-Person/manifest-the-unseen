## Script

### INTRO (0:00 - 1:00)

**[Bowl - 528Hz, let it ring for 10 seconds]**

**[River begins softly]**

Welcome back to stillness.

**[Pause 5s]**

Settle into this moment. This breath. This now.

**[Pause 7s]**

Feel your body soften.

**[Pause 5s]**

Feel your thoughts slow.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Bowl - softer strike]**

---

### SETTLING & OBSERVATION (1:00 - 2:30)

Notice... in this moment... are you forcing anything?

**[Pause 7s]**

Perhaps you're trying to relax. Trying to meditate. Trying to manifest.

**[Pause 5s]**

Even the word "trying"... carries force.

**[Pause 7s]**

Let it go. For now.

**[Pause 10s]**

What if... there was nothing to do? No effort required?

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Throat singing begins - very subtle, like a distant hum]**

---

### CORE TEACHING - THE RIVER (2:30 - 6:00)

Imagine a river.

**[Pause 5s]**

**[River sound slightly more present]**

The water does not force its way downstream.

**[Pause 5s]**

It simply flows. Following the path of least resistance.

**[Pause 7s]**

When it meets a stone... it does not push. It goes around.

**[Pause 5s]**

When it meets a cliff... it does not strain. It becomes a waterfall.

**[Pause 10s]**

The river is not lazy. It is not weak.

**[Pause 5s]**

It is aligned. With gravity. With the earth. With what is.

**[Pause 10s]**

This is frequency. Not force.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Bowl - gentle, clear strike]**

Now... bring to mind something you've been forcing.

**[Pause 5s]**

A manifestation. A relationship. A change.

**[Pause 7s]**

Notice where in your body you feel the strain. The push. The grip.

**[Pause 10s]**

Is it in your chest? Your belly? Your jaw?

**[Pause 7s]**

Breathe into that place. Slowly.

**[Pause 10s]**

And ask: What if I didn't have to push?

**[Pause 7s]**

What if... this desire... already exists?

**[Pause 5s]**

Not out there. Not in the future.

**[Pause 5s]**

But here. Now. As a frequency. A vibration.

**[Pause 10s]**

You don't create the radio station. You tune into it.

**[Pause 7s]**

**[Throat singing slightly more present]**

---

### ALIGNMENT PRACTICE (6:00 - 8:30)

Let's practice tuning in.

**[Pause 5s]**

Imagine your desired reality. Not as something distant.

**[Pause 5s]**

But as a frequency... already broadcasting.

**[Pause 7s]**

Can you feel it? Even faintly?

**[Pause 10s]**

It feels like... relief. Like ease. Like yes.

**[Pause 7s]**

Not excitement. Not urgency. Just... rightness.

**[Pause 10s]**

This is your frequency.

**[Pause 5s]**

Now... release any need to make it happen.

**[Pause 7s]**

The river does not make itself flow.

**[Pause 5s]**

The flower does not force itself to bloom.

**[Pause 5s]**

The earth does not strain to orbit the sun.

**[Pause 10s]**

There is an intelligence. A design. A natural order.

**[Pause 7s]**

You are part of it. Not separate from it.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Swell - throat singing and river merge beautifully]**

Align with your frequency. And let the river carry you.

**[Pause 10s]**

---

### CLOSING (8:30 - 10:00)

For these final moments... simply rest in alignment.

**[Pause 7s]**

No effort. No strain. No force.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Fade - throat singing recedes]**

As you return to your day... remember this feeling.

**[Pause 5s]**

When you notice yourself pushing... pause.

**[Pause 5s]**

When you feel yourself straining... soften.

**[Pause 7s]**

Frequency over force. Always.

**[Pause 10s]**

Begin now to deepen your breath.

**[Pause 5s]**

Gentle movement returning.

**[Pause 7s]**

And when you're ready... open your eyes.

**[Pause 10s]**

**[Bowl - final 528Hz strike, let ring for 15 seconds]**

**[Fade - all sound to silence over 10 seconds]**
