## Technical Considerations

### Interactive Visualizations

- Use libraries like D3.js, Recharts, or Canvas API for complex charts
- Progress integration: Visualizations update based on `workbook_progress` data
- Real-time updates: Visualizations refresh as user completes exercises
- Export capabilities: Users can save/share visualization states

### Visualization Examples to Keep

- Wheel of Life: Circular chart with draggable sliders
- Vision Board: Drag-drop image grid with categories
- Venn Diagram: Interactive overlapping circles
- Timeline: Progress bars with completion markers
- Gratitude Jar: Filling animation based on entries
- Charts: Line/bar charts showing progress over time

## Next Steps (After Confirmation)

1. Confirm which 5 phases
2. Confirm which 2-3 journal types
3. Update all documentation files
4. Update database schema
5. Update task files
6. Begin implementation
