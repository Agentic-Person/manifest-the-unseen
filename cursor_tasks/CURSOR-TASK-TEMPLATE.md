## Task ID: [XXX] - [Task Title]

**Status:** 
- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [X] Finished - Code complete, ready for integration
- [X] Integrated - Connected to backend/APIs, data flows correctly
- [X] Tested - Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing complete

**Week/Phase:** Week X

**Agent:** Cursor Agent X - [Role]

**MCP Servers Used:**
