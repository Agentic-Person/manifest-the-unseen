### Senior Engineer Notes

#### What to Build

Phase 2 helps users define their vision and purpose:

1. **Digital Vision Board**: Users upload images representing their goals/desires. Organize by categories (Health, Wealth, Love, Travel, Career, Spirituality). Drag-and-drop interface.

2. **Purpose Venn Diagram**: Four overlapping circles representing Passion, Profession, Vocation, Mission. Users add items to each circle. Center shows overlap = purpose sweet spot.

3. **Vision Statement Tree**: Hierarchical tree visualization with editable text nodes. Root = overall vision, branches = major life areas, leaves = specific goals.

**MCP Usage:**
- Canva MCP: Design specifications
- Supabase MCP: Save vision board images (URLs), Venn diagram data, tree structure
